# YouTube Downloader (Browser Extension)

**Save YouTube videos instantly for offline viewing.**

YouTube Downloader plugs into watch pages, Shorts, and embedded players, decrypts YouTube's adaptive streams, and delivers high-quality MP4 or WebM files you can use offline. It handles encrypted URLs, merges separate video/audio tracks automatically, and keeps a clean queue so creators and researchers can archive content reliably.

- Archive Shorts, embedded players, and unlisted review links without quality loss
- Deliver ready-to-edit MP4 files by merging adaptive streams automatically
- Keep projects private thanks to on-device decryption and background processing

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does it work with YouTube Shorts and embedded players?

Yes. The extension detects Shorts feeds, standard watch pages, and embedded players on third-party sites, then serves the same quality list in each case.

### Can I download a livestream while it is broadcasting?

The downloader supports livestream replays, but it needs the on-demand version to exist first. Once the replay is posted it converts the HLS stream into a single MP4.

### Will it download movies or episodes I purchased on YouTube?

No. DRM-protected purchases remain off limits. The downloader only works on videos you can already view without digital rights management.

### How many downloads can run simultaneously?

Up to three downloads can be active at once. Each item shows progress, speed, and an interrupt button so you can prioritise what matters.

### Do I need to keep the video tab open the whole time?

For long conversions we recommend keeping the original tab open. That ensures the stream segments stay available until the MP4 is finalised.

### Which browsers are supported?

Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and Opera are supported. Make sure you're on an up-to-date build for Manifest V3 compatibility.

## Permissions Justifications

### activeTab

Injects the downloader UI into the YouTube page you're viewing, including Shorts feeds and embedded players.

### tabs

### scripting

### notifications

### contextMenus

Adds a "Download with YouTube Downloader" option when you right-click embedded videos for quicker access.

### host_permissions

Limits privileged access to youtube.com, youtu.be, and YouTube CDN domains required to capture and decrypt the streams.

## About

YouTube is the world's largest video platform, hosting billions of videos from creators, educators, businesses, and entertainers. However, YouTube doesn't provide a built-in way to download videos for offline viewing‚Äîeven for content you want to reference, archive, or watch without an internet connection.

YouTube Downloader solves this by seamlessly integrating with YouTube's watch pages, Shorts, and embedded players to give you instant access to high-quality MP4 and WebM files. Whether you're a content creator backing up your work, a researcher archiving educational content, or someone who wants to watch videos offline during travel, this extension makes it simple and reliable.
